## üîß Installation

### Node.js Installation

#### macOS/Linux
You can use `asdf` to manage Node.js versions:
```bash
# Install asdf (if not already installed)
git clone https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf.git ~/.asdf --branch v0.10.2
echo '. $HOME/.asdf/asdf.sh' >> ~/.bashrc
echo '. $HOME/.asdf/completions/asdf.bash' >> ~/.bashrc
# or for zsh
echo '. $HOME/.asdf/asdf.sh' >> ~/.zshrc

# Install Node.js plugin
asdf plugin add nodejs
asdf install nodejs 18.12.0  # or any version >= 14
asdf global nodejs 18.12.0
```

#### Windows
Download and install Node.js directly from the official website:
1. Visit [Node.js official download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. Download the Windows Installer (.msi)
3. Run the installer and follow the installation wizard
4. Verify installation by opening Command Prompt or PowerShell and typing:
```
node --version
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

You can run Hello-MCP without installation using npx:

```bash
npx hello-mcp
```

This will start the setup wizard that guides you through the entire configuration process.

## üéÆ Usage

Hello-MCP can be used in three different modes:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Setup Mode (Default)

```bash
npx hello-mcp
# or
npx hello-mcp setup
```

This interactive mode will:
- Check if Claude Desktop is installed
- Ask for your email and purpose
- Generate an API key
- Configure Claude Desktop for MCP
- Restart Claude Desktop automatically (when possible)

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ MCP Server Mode

```bash
npx hello-mcp mcp-server
```

This starts Hello-MCP as an MCP server that Claude Desktop can connect to. The server provides tools that Claude can use to perform actions.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ CLI Mode

```bash
npx hello-mcp cli [command] [options]
```

Available commands:
- `add`: Add two numbers
  ```bash
  npx hello-mcp cli add 3 5
  ```
- `send-email`: Send an email
  ```bash
  npx hello-mcp cli send-email user@example.com "Hello from Hello-MCP"
  ```

## üîë API Keys

Your API key is stored in `~/.garakrc` and has a daily limit of 50 requests. The key is automatically configured for use with Claude Desktop.

## üåê Internationalization (i18n)

Hello-MCP supports multiple languages through a robust internationalization architecture.

**Key Features:**

- **Language Files:** Separate JSON files for each language (e.g., `ko.json`, `en.json`) in the `locales/` directory.
- **Automatic Language Detection:**
    - Detects language based on environment variables (`LC_ALL`, `LANG`, `LANGUAGE`).
    - Detects operating system settings (macOS, Windows).
    - Uses language preference stored in the user configuration file (`.garakrc`).
- **Placeholder Support:** Dynamic text insertion using placeholders (e.g., `{variable}`).
- **Language Switching:**
    - `npx hello-mcp lang` command to select language via a UI.
    -  Quick language switching using environment variables (e.g., `LC_ALL=en node index.js`).

## üìä Telemetry

Hello-MCP collects anonymous usage data to improve the service:
- User interactions and performance metrics
- All data is anonymized
- You can disable telemetry in the configuration

## üåü Tips for Using with Claude

After setup, you can try these prompts with Claude:
1. "1 add 1" (Simple calculation)
2. "Send an email to [your-email] with the result of 1 add 1"
